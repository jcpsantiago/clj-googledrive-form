# Plan B

This is a temporary solution for getting CSV/Excel files from customers. Sometimes we don't have enough bank transactions form customers to score them, which is not ideal. With this form, customers send us their data, it lands on Google Drive -- from where it will never leave -- and a person responsible for cleaning them gets easy access.

The whole process is documented here https://ozean12.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RA/pages/835223569/Manually+scoring+customers
